    <p>Hello! My name is Alexandre Mathurin. I'm currently a student enrolled at
    Queens College under the computer science major.
    I graduate in 2025</p>

  <p> At the moment I've learned quite a bit about computer programming, but I'm always eager to learn more (and theres always more to learn!).
    I've learned a decent amount of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, C++, and Java.
    Given time I plan to develop my skills to greather heights!</p>

  <p>  What would I do with said skills? I'm still finding out, but as of right now
    I've taken a profound interest in software engineering. </p>
