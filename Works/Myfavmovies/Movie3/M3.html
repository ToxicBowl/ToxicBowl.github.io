  <p>"In this animated feature by noted Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki,
    10-year-old Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi) and her parents (Takashi Naitô, Yasuko Sawaguchi)
    stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park.
    After her mother and father are turned into giant pigs,
    Chihiro meets the mysterious Haku (Miyu Irino), who explains
    that the park is a resort for supernatural beings
     who need a break from their time spent in the earthly realm,
     and that she must work there to free herself and her parents."

<p>This film really takes you for a ride. You may not think much of it at first, but once it gets going
  it really takes you for a ride. Just like Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki has invited us to another strange
  and mysterious world teeming with a colorful cast of characters. Once again the animation and art are superb and
  really elevate this movie to great heights.
</p>

<p>Another great Ghibli film. There's a reason they're held to such a high standard. Check 'em out!'</p>
