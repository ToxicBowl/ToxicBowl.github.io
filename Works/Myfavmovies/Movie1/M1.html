  <p>"Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway,
    Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into
    the one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker,
    he soon realizes that there are many others who share his special, high-flying talents.
    Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin,
    a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes and pull
    different versions of Spider-Man into our world."

<p>I really like this movie. It's a very unique take on the origin's of Spiderman
  and the colorful cast if Spidermen(and women) from other universes really adds
  flair to the movie. Not to mention the beautiful animations and vibrant backgrounds
  found in each and every scene.
</p>

<p>This film is fantastic and I recommend you watch it if you haven't.</p>
